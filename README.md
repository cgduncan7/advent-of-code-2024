# Advent of Code 2024

Haskell-style.

Solutions can be found in `days/DayX.hs`

Tests can be found in `tests/dayX/Main.hs`

Everything is done with a Makefile.

## Making a new day

```bash
$ make new day=1
```

## Running a day's solution

```bash
$ make run day=1 <part=1>
```

## Testing a day's solution

```bash
$ make test day=1
```
